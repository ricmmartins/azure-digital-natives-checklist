# Documentation: Cost Management & FinOps

This document provides further details and context for the Cost Management & FinOps section of the Azure Startup Checklist.

## [ ] Utilize Azure Cost Management + Billing

*   **Why:** Understanding where your Azure spend is going is fundamental. Azure Cost Management provides tools to monitor, analyze, and optimize your costs.
*   **How:** Regularly access the Cost Management + Billing section in the Azure portal. Use cost analysis tools to break down costs by service, resource group, tag, location, etc. Set up scheduled exports for offline analysis if needed.
*   **Resources:**

## [ ] Set up budgets and spending alerts

*   **Why:** Budgets act as spending limits or targets, and alerts provide early warnings when costs are approaching or exceeding these thresholds. This prevents unexpected billing surprises.
*   **How:** Create budgets at different scopes (subscription, resource group). Define budget amounts and time periods (monthly, quarterly, annually). Configure alert thresholds (e.g., at 80%, 100% of budget) and specify recipients for notifications (email, action group).

## [ ] Regularly review Azure Advisor recommendations

*   **Why:** Azure Advisor is a free service that analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry to provide personalized recommendations for optimizing cost, performance, reliability, operational excellence, and security.
*   **How:** Access Azure Advisor regularly through the Azure portal. Review recommendations, especially in the "Cost" category. Evaluate the potential savings and implementation effort for each suggestion.

## [ ] Evaluate cost optimization options

*   **Why:** Azure offers several pricing models and purchasing options that can significantly reduce costs for predictable workloads.
*   **How:**
    *   **Azure Reservations:** Commit to a one- or three-year plan for specific resources (like VMs, SQL Database capacity) in exchange for significant discounts compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.
    *   **Azure Savings Plans:** Commit to a fixed hourly spend on compute services for one or three years to receive discounts.
    *   **Spot Virtual Machines:** Utilize Azure's unused compute capacity at very low prices for workloads that can tolerate interruptions (e.g., batch processing, dev/test environments).
*   **Resources:**

## [ ] Understand FinOps basics

*   **Why:** FinOps is a cultural practice that brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of the cloud, enabling teams to make informed trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality.
*   **How:** Familiarize your team with FinOps principles: collaboration between finance, tech, and business teams; visibility into cloud spending; accountability for costs; and ongoing optimization.
