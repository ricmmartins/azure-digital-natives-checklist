# Azure Startup Checklist Repository

## Overview

Welcome! This repository provides an actionable checklist and guidance for digital native startups building on Microsoft Azure. It aims to consolidate essential best practices, particularly for teams moving from Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stages towards more robust, production-grade environments.

The checklist is derived from insights shared in the Microsoft Tech Community article: [The Digital Native's Checklist for Azure: Stuff I wish every startup knew](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/startupsatmicrosoftblog/the-digital-natives-checklist-for-azure-stuff-i-wish-every-startup-knew/4406669).

## Purpose

*   **Provide a practical starting point:** Offer a clear list of crucial Azure configurations and practices.
*   **Promote best practices early:** Encourage foundational security, cost management, and operational excellence from the beginning.
*   **Facilitate knowledge sharing:** Create a reusable asset for teams and individuals within the startup ecosystem.
*   **Bridge the gap:** Help teams transition smoothly from rapid prototyping to scalable and maintainable solutions.

## How to Use

1.  **Review the Checklist:** Start with the main [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md) file. It provides a high-level overview of key areas and actionable items using Markdown checkboxes.
2.  **Dive Deeper:** For more context, rationale, and links to official documentation or tutorials for specific checklist items, navigate to the corresponding file within the [docs/](./docs/) directory.
3.  **Track Progress:** Fork this repository or copy the `CHECKLIST.md` content and use the checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to track your team's progress.
4.  **Explore Scripts (Optional):** Check the [scripts/](./scripts/) directory for potential automation snippets (Azure CLI, Bicep, etc.) to help implement certain recommendations (Note: This section may be under development).
5.  **Contribute:** Share your own experiences, suggest improvements, or add relevant resources by following the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
